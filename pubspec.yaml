# The following line prevents the package from being accidentally published to
# pub.dev using `flutter pub publish`. This is preferred for private packages.
publish_to: "none" # Remove this line if you wish to publish to pub.dev

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at
# https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html
# In Windows, build-name is used as the major, minor, and patch parts
# of the product and file versions while build-number is used as the build suffix.

# To automatically upgrade your package dependencies to the latest versions
# consider running `flutter pub upgrade --major-versions`. Alternatively,
# dependencies can be manually updated by changing the version numbers below to
# the latest version available on pub.dev. To see which dependencies have newer
# versions available, run `flutter pub outdated`.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/Illustration.svg
    - assets/images/Avatar.png
    - assets/images/coolicon.svg
    - assets/images/group.svg
    - assets/images/Menu.svg
    - assets/images/lion.jpg
    - assets/images/Vector.svg
    - assets/images/AvatarStory.svg
    - assets/images/Account.svg
    - assets/images/Chats.svg
    - assets/images/Appearence.svg
    - assets/images/Notification.svg
    - assets/images/Privacy.svg
    - assets/images/Data.svg
    - assets/images/Help.svg
    - assets/images/Invite.svg
    - assets/images/Send.svg
    - assets/images/sound.svg
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Mulish
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Mulish-Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Mulish-Italic.ttf
          style: italic
        - asset: assets/fonts/Mulish-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: assets/fonts/Mulish-Black.ttf
          weight: 900
        - asset: assets/fonts/Mulish-ExtraBold.ttf
          weight: 800
        - asset: assets/fonts/Mulish-ExtraLight.ttf
          weight: 200
        - asset: assets/fonts/Mulish-Light.ttf
          weight: 300
        - asset: assets/fonts/Mulish-Medium.ttf
          weight: 500
        - asset: assets/fonts/Mulish-SemiBold.ttf
          weight: 600
